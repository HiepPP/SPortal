Love is love, if there is any pretext for the love which means love is not profound enough.
If love isn't profound enough, why worry to be hurt, at worst when separating just crying and turning away.
Such is the appearance of a wound in the heart , you do not touch it , it will quickly disappear in the next relationship.
