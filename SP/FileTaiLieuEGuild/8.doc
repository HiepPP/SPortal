Sometimes you need to experience everything so that you would learn. There’s no easy way in living life so live it as it is.
Cry...
Laugh...
Be crazy...
And don’t miss the chances life is giving you because the most important things are not “THINGS” at all. Most of the time they are “PEOPLE” making your life worth living.
